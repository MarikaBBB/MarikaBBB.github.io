When I finished my first project, I decided that I wanted to create different folders for each project under the same repository on Github Pages. I thought it would be a good idea to create a new landing page (html.index) where I could store links to each project's web pages.

However, changing the structure of my Github repository turned out to be more challenging than I thought. As someone who is relatively new to Git and Github, I had to follow a few steps to achieve my goal:

First, I had to create new folders for each project. I did this by using the Github Desktop application, which allowed me to easily create new folders in my local repository.

Next, I had to move my project files to the new folders. This was a bit tricky because I had to use the "git mv" command in the command line to move the files or drag and drop the files in the Github Desktop application.

After moving the files to the new folders, I had to commit the changes to my local repository using the "git commit" command in the command line. Then, I had to push the changes to the remote repository on Github using the "git push" command.

Finally, I created a new landing page in the root directory of my repository by creating a new HTML file called "index.html." In this file, I added links to the web pages of each project. Once I finished this, I committed and pushed the new landing page changes to the remote repository on Github using the same steps as before.

Overall, changing the structure of my Github repository was a bit challenging, especially since I'm still new to Git and Github.
