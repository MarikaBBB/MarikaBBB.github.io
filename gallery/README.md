Gallery Project README

This project is a gallery showcasing the projects I have been working on. Each project has a card with a title, an image, and a description. The gallery uses flexbox to arrange the cards on the page and resizes the cards based on screen width. The layout adapts to the gallery when the browser window resizes and displays the cards in a single column on mobile devices. Each card also has a clickable button that opens and closes the description text.

Planning

Before starting the project, I planned out the HTML structure and CSS styles. I decided to use flexbox to arrange the cards and used media queries to make the gallery responsive. I made sure to gather all the necessary assets (images and text) for each project before beginning the project.

Building

I started building the project by creating the HTML structure for each card and the gallery container. I added the necessary CSS styles to make the cards and gallery look visually appealing. I used JavaScript to create the expand/collapse button functionality. I tested the gallery on different screen sizes and made adjustments to the CSS styles to ensure that the gallery looked good on all devices.

Debugging

During the building process, I encountered a few bugs. One of the biggest issues was getting the expand/collapse button to work properly. I had to write and test several versions of the JavaScript code before finding a solution that worked. I also had to make some adjustments to the CSS styles to ensure that the gallery looked good on all devices. Overall, the debugging process was time-consuming but rewarding.
Write the difficulty to adjust screen size for mobile phone.
